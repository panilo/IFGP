### 2) Prepare the pancetta and boil the pasta

Set two pans to fire, one fry pan and one for the pasta. Once the fry pan is hot then set pancetta to cook and wait 'till is ready (crunchy, brown).

Take a little bit of water from the pasta pan and put it into the egg bowl. Mix the pancetta and the rest of the parmesan you got left from point 1, stir it until is more liquid than before. Then drain the pasta.
